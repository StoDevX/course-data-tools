Starts with one of `Prerequisite:`, `Prerequisites:`, or `Prerequisite/corequisite:`. Note that usage of the singular form of Prerequisite does not imply a single prerequisite.

Can ignore sentences starting with "Counts towards", "Offered", "GE:",

Need to pull out things like "Materials fee", "P/N only", "offered", 'Taught in <language>', etc. for usage in other places.

Watch out for:
	- "Credit may be earned for either X or Y, but not both."
	- "Prerequisite: three courses in area of study"
	- "The course cannot be taken in conjunction with or after credit in Chemistry 121."
	- "Open to..."
	- "Prerequisites for certain offerings." (???!!!...)

Should include some sort of "Possible Misunderstanding! Check Manually!" flag.

Remove text about "Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term." to reduce confusion within Gobbldygook.
